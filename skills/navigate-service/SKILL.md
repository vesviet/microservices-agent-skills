# Navigate Service Skill

Use this skill when the user asks to understand, explore, or navigate a specific microservice in this project.

## When to Use
- User asks "how does the X service work?"
- User wants to understand the architecture of a service
- User needs to find where specific logic is implemented
- User is unfamiliar with a service and needs orientation
- Before making changes to a service (to understand context first)

## Project Service Registry

All services follow the same **Clean Architecture + DDD** pattern built with the **Go Kratos Framework**.

### Service Directories (relative to `/Users/tuananh/Desktop/myproject/microservice/`)
| Service | Directory | HTTP Port | gRPC Port |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Auth | `auth/` | 8000 | 9000 |

## Standard Go Service Structure

Each Go microservice follows this directory layout:

```
<service>/
├── cmd/
│   ├── <service>/         # Main entry point (main.go, wire.go, wire_gen.go)
│   ├── migrate/           # Database migration CLI
│   └── worker/            # Background worker (if applicable)
├── api/
│   └── <service>/
│       └── v1/            # Proto definitions (.proto) and generated code (.pb.go)
├── internal/
│   ├── biz/               # 🔴 DOMAIN LAYER - Business logic, use cases, domain entities
│   │   ├── <entity>.go    # Domain entity + repository interface
│   │   └── <usecase>.go   # Business use case implementation
│   ├── data/              # 🟢 DATA LAYER - Repository implementations, database queries
│   │   ├── data.go        # Database connection setup
│   │   ├── <entity>.go    # Repository implementation (implements biz interfaces)
│   │   └── model/         # Database models (GORM structs)
│   ├── service/           # 🔵 API LAYER - gRPC/HTTP service implementation
│   │   └── <service>.go   # Translates API requests to biz calls
│   ├── server/            # Server configuration (HTTP, gRPC, middleware)
│   │   ├── http.go
│   │   ├── grpc.go
│   │   └── middleware.go
│   ├── client/            # gRPC clients to other services
│   ├── model/             # Shared models/DTOs
│   └── config/            # Configuration proto
├── configs/
│   └── config.yaml        # Service configuration
├── migrations/            # SQL migration files (Goose format)
├── Dockerfile
├── Makefile

## Step-by-Step Navigation Process

When asked to navigate/understand a service, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Service
Determine which service the user is asking about. Map their request to the service directory.

### Step 2: Read the Entry Point
```
View: cmd/<service>/main.go
```
This shows how the service is bootstrapped, what dependencies are injected via Wire.

### Step 3: Read the API Layer (Proto Definitions)
```
View: api/<service>/v1/*.proto
```
This defines all API endpoints (gRPC & HTTP), request/response messages.

### Step 4: Read the Domain Layer (Business Logic)
```
View: internal/biz/*.go
```
This is the MOST IMPORTANT layer. Contains:
- Domain entities and value objects
- Repository interfaces (contracts)
- Business use cases and rules

### Step 5: Read the Data Layer (Repository Implementations)
```
View: internal/data/*.go
```
Contains database queries, GORM models, and repository implementations.

### Step 6: Read the Service Layer (API Implementation)
```
View: internal/service/*.go
```
Translates gRPC/HTTP requests into domain calls.

### Step 7: Check Configuration
```
View: configs/config.yaml
```
Shows database connections, service ports, external dependencies.

### Step 8: Check Migrations
```
View: migrations/*.sql
```
Shows database schema and its evolution.

## Key Patterns to Explain

### Dependency Injection (Wire)
- `cmd/<service>/wire.go` defines the dependency graph
- `cmd/<service>/wire_gen.go` is auto-generated, never edit manually

### Event-Driven Communication
- Services publish/subscribe events via **Dapr PubSub** (Redis Streams)
- Event definitions: `common/events/` or in each service's `internal/biz/`
- Look for `PublishEvent`, `SubscribeEvent`, or Dapr pub/sub references

### Service-to-Service Communication
- Via gRPC clients in `internal/client/`
- Service discovery through Consul

### Common Library
- Shared utilities: `common/` (module: `gitlab.com/ta-microservices/common`)
- Includes: middleware, validation, errors, events, config, security, utils

## Output Format

When presenting a service overview, structure your response as:

1. **Service Purpose** - What business domain it handles
2. **API Endpoints** - Key endpoints from proto files
3. **Domain Entities** - Core entities and their relationships
4. **Business Rules** - Key use cases and rules
5. **Data Model** - Database schema (from migrations)
6. **Dependencies** - Other services it calls and infrastructure needs
7. **Event Integration** - Events published/subscribed
