# Supply Chain Security

Use this skill when hardening the software supply chain against tampering, undisclosed vulnerabilities, and dependency risks. Applies to application builds, AI/ML pipeline artifacts, MCP server registries, and agent skill registries.

## When to Use

- hardening CI/CD pipelines
- generating SBOMs (CycloneDX/SPDX)
- achieving SLSA Level 2/3 provenance
- auditing third-party deps including MCP registries

## Core Rules

- **SBOM-first**: generate a Software Bill of Materials for every production artifact — at build time, not post-deploy.
- **SLSA incremental**: target SLSA Level 2 as minimum baseline; Level 3 for production workloads with external consumers.
- **Artifact signing**: sign all release artifacts cryptographically (Sigstore/cosign preferred); never ship unsigned artifacts to external registries.
- **VEX context**: complement every SBOM with VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) to declare which CVEs are not exploitable in this deployment context.
- **Living SBOM**: feed SBOMs into continuous monitoring (Dependency-Track or SCA) — a static snapshot is insufficient.
- **MCP registry governance**: treat every MCP server dependency as a supply-chain artifact; include in SBOM with publisher provenance check, behavioral analysis, and version pinning.
- **AI-generated code provenance**: apply the same SLSA provenance checks to AI-generated code as to human-authored code; do not assume AI output is clean.
- **OWASP-ASI04-AGENTIC-SUPPLY-CHAIN**: Per OWASP ASI04 — every skill, tool, or plugin pulled from an external registry must be version-pinned and schema-validated before invocation; every MCP server dependency must appear in the SBOM with publisher identity verification; treat unverified skills and tools as untrusted until schema-validated.
- **SLSA-V1.1-MULTI-TRACK**: Use SLSA v1.1 with multi-track provenance (Build, Source, Package tracks); GitHub Actions require SHA pinning to 40-char commit SHAs (not tag refs) for SLSA L3 build integrity.
- **SLSA-V1.2-2027**: Target SLSA v1.2 — the current approved spec — and track its two working-draft tracks toward 2027 formalization: the **Build Environment track** (provenance for build images, hardware-level system-state attestation) and the **Dependency track** (Dependency Ingestion Provenance; L1 Inventoried / L2 Controlled / L3 Screened, where L3 structurally blocks bypass and isolates platform signing from dependency code — designed against the Shai Hulud npm-worm threat model).
- **UNSIGNED-UNDEPLOYABLE**: raise the release gate from "produce SBOM" to "produce signed SLSA Build L3 provenance + Dependency Ingestion Provenance (L2 minimum, L3 for externally consumed deps), verified via Cosign/Sigstore before deploy"; PyPI, Maven Central, and Homebrew already default to Sigstore — treat unsigned agent-built artifacts as undeployable.
- **AST02-ALIGNMENT**: dependency pinning must use immutable hashes, never ranges; map skill/MCP dependency pinning to SLSA Dependency L2 "Controlled" and to OWASP AST02 (skill supply chain compromise).
- **CYCLONEDX-1.6-AI-ML-BOM**: For AI/ML artifacts (model weights, training data), generate CycloneDX 1.6 AI/ML BOMs including model weights SHA-256 hashes, training data provenance, and quantization metadata — regulatory compliance requires this for EU AI Act Article 13.
- **GUAC-BLAST-RADIUS**: Use GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition) for blast-radius queries after a CVE disclosure — enables queries like "which of our artifacts depend on log4j?" across the full dependency graph.

## SLSA Levels Reference

| Level | Requirement | Practical Target |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | Provenance exists | Minimum for new projects |
| **L2** | Tamper-resistant provenance (signed) | Enterprise baseline 2026 |
| **L3** | Hardened build environment (hermetic) | Production with external consumers |
| **L4** | Two-party review + hermetic | High-assurance / regulated |

## SBOM Format Selection

| Format | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **CycloneDX** | DevSecOps pipelines, vulnerability management, VEX support |
| **SPDX** | Legal review, license compliance, formal documentation workflows |
| **Both** | Mature orgs with both DevSecOps and legal review requirements |

## Suggested Process

### 1. SBOM Generation (CI Integration)

Integrate SBOM generation into the CI/CD pipeline on every build:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example (CycloneDX)
- name: Generate SBOM
  uses: CycloneDX/gh-dotnet-generate-sbom@v1
  with:
    path: ./
    out: ./sbom.json
    json: true

- name: Store SBOM with artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: sbom-${{ github.sha }}
    path: ./sbom.json
```

Key rules:
- store SBOM alongside the build artifact (not separately)
- include version, license, hash, and source commit for every component
- for MCP server dependencies: add publisher identity, behavioral analysis status, version-pinned hash

### 2. SLSA Provenance (Level 2+)

Generate provenance metadata documenting how the artifact was built:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions — SLSA provenance via slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator
jobs:
  build:
    outputs:
      digest: ${{ steps.build.outputs.digest }}
    steps:
      - name: Build
        id: build
        run: |
          docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
          echo "digest=$(docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' myapp:${{ github.sha }})" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  provenance:
    needs: build
    uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_container_slsa3.yml@v2
    with:
      image: myapp
      digest: ${{ needs.build.outputs.digest }}
```

### 3. Artifact Signing (Sigstore/cosign)

```bash
# Sign container image
cosign sign --key cosign.key myregistry/myapp:$TAG

# Verify signature
cosign verify --key cosign.pub myregistry/myapp:$TAG

# Sign SBOM
cosign attest --key cosign.key --type cyclonedx myregistry/myapp:$TAG
```

### 4. VEX Document (Vulnerability Exploitability)

```json
{
  "bomFormat": "CycloneDX",
  "specVersion": "1.5",
  "version": 1,
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "id": "CVE-2024-XXXXX",
      "analysis": {
        "state": "not_affected",
        "justification": "code_not_reachable",
        "detail": "Vulnerable code path is not invoked in this deployment configuration"
      },
      "affects": [{ "ref": "pkg:npm/affected-package@1.2.3" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Continuous Monitoring

Feed SBOMs into Dependency-Track or equivalent SCA tool:
- configure alerts for new CVEs affecting components in SBOM
- set policy: reject builds when critical/high CVEs exist without VEX justification
- review MCP server SBOMs on every registry update, not just on initial adoption

## Checklist

- [ ] SBOM generated at build time (CycloneDX or SPDX format selected based on use case)
- [ ] SBOM stored alongside build artifact in registry
- [ ] SLSA Level 2+ provenance generated and attached to artifact
- [ ] All release artifacts cryptographically signed (cosign/Sigstore)
- [ ] VEX context documented for all known CVEs affecting this deployment
- [ ] SBOMs fed into continuous monitoring (Dependency-Track or SCA tool)
- [ ] MCP server dependencies: publisher identity verified, version-pinned, behavioral analysis complete
- [ ] AI-generated code passes same provenance checks as human-authored code
- [ ] OWASP ASI04 supply chain posture confirmed: no unverified skills/tools in active toolbox

## Output Format

- `sbom.cdx.json` or `sbom.spdx.json` — Bill of Materials for the artifact
- `provenance.intoto.jsonl` — SLSA provenance attestation
- `vex.cdx.json` — Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange document
- Updated `contracts/schemas/deployment-plan.json` when supply chain attestations are a deploy gate

## Output Contracts

When this skill is invoked as part of a coordinated multi-role delivery, emit:

- **contracts/schemas/deployment-plan.json** — Required fields: infrastructure_changes[], config_updates[], and 
alidation_run. Set produced_by_role to the emitting developer role.

Skip emission for solo refactor work where no downstream handoff is expected.

## Failure Modes

- **Unsigned dependency**: a build pulls an unsigned or unverified dependency. Mitigation: enforce SLSA build provenance; verify signatures in CI.
- **SBOM drift**: the SBOM is out of sync with the actual build artifacts. Mitigation: regenerate the SBOM in CI; fail the build on drift.
- **Vulnerable transitive dependency**: a transitive dependency has a known CVE. Mitigation: pin to patched versions; run `npm audit` / `pip-audit` in CI.
- **Build provenance missing**: a release artifact is published without provenance attestation. Mitigation: generate CycloneDX or in-toto attestations in CI; reject unsigned artifacts.
- **Registry compromise**: a package is pulled from a mirror or registry that has been compromised. Mitigation: use only the official registry; pin by hash; verify the signature.

## Related Skills

- **setup-deployment**: deployment source-of-truth — supply-chain-security outputs are a pre-deploy gate
- **manage-secrets**: securely store signing keys and registry credentials
- **security-audit**: holistic security review that references SBOM findings
- **configure-mcp**: every MCP server added must have SBOM entry and registry provenance check
