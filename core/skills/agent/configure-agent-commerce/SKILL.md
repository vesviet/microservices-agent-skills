# Configure Agent Commerce

Use this skill when integrating agent-driven checkout and commerce discovery flows using agentic standards: the x402 HTTP payment protocol, Stripe's Machine Payments Protocol (MPP), the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), and Google's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2).

## Protocol Landscape (2026 — correct names and layering)

These standards are complementary layers, not interchangeable, and they do not interoperate — select by layer and document the choice:

- **MCP** (Anthropic / AAIF-Linux Foundation): the tool/data discovery plane underneath commerce; it never moves money itself.
- **UCP — Universal Commerce Protocol** (Google + Shopify): agent product discovery, capability negotiation, and checkout. (Note: UCP is *not* "User Context Protocol".)
- **ACP — Agentic Commerce Protocol** (OpenAI + Stripe): agent checkout over existing card rails; shipped in ChatGPT.
- **MPP — Machine Payments Protocol** (Stripe + Tempo/Paradigm) and **x402** (Coinbase + Cloudflare): HTTP 402 machine-payment settlement (fiat, cards, and stablecoins).
- **AP2 — Agent Payments Protocol** (Google; FIDO Alliance-governed): payment-agnostic authorization/mandate layer proving a user delegated a purchase to an agent.

## Core Rules

- Adhere strictly to the x402 and Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) metadata requirements.
- Expose agent checkout via the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) at the documented path; resolve user delegation limits and preferences through an AP2 mandate / delegated-authorization context, not by conflating it with UCP.
- Never expose payment credentials or secret keys — only reference identifiers and public metadata.
- x402 responses must return HTTP 402 carrying the payment requirements in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header and JSON body. There is no `WWW-Authenticate` challenge in x402 — do not invent one.
- Use the x402 v2 header names: `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` (server challenge), `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` (client credential), `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (server receipt). The v1 `X-PAYMENT` header was **client-sent** and is deprecated; never emit it from the server.
- Verify the ACP and UCP discovery surfaces against the current published specs before wiring them — ACP is defined by REST endpoints, not by a well-known manifest (see Discovery Surfaces below).
- do not bind the programmatic flow to human-centric checkout interfaces or Stripe-specific SDK redirects
- treat every payment proof, mandate, and checkout session as a signed artifact; verify the signature against the issuer's published keys before granting access (OWASP ASI04 / ASI07)
- never log full payment credentials, mandate contents, or PII; classify any output through `data-classification.yaml` and redact restricted fields
- confirm the agent customer is operating under a verified identity (DID or scope-bound token) before honoring delegated purchase authority; reject anonymous or unverified agents at the mandate layer (OWASP ASI03)
- **Rail selection is a per-transaction decision**: x402 (stablecoin, HTTP-native, min ~$0.01, EVM/Solana) vs MPP/Shared Payment Tokens (card rails via Stripe, min $0.50, Link Agent Wallet issuer). Choose by buyer capability and settlement preference; 2027 convergence runs x402-as-transport with card-rail settlement options (Visa/Mastercard sit inside the x402 Foundation alongside Stripe/Adyen/Google)
- **Execution-time authorization (IETF execution-finality alignment)**: a signed instruction is not settlement, and tool selection is not execution — every consequential payment must pass a server-side authorization check at execution time (amount against mandate, velocity against limit, idempotency against replay cache), never solely at tool-selection time
- Enforce agent-spend guardrails by default: per-agent transaction caps, daily/velocity budgets, human-in-the-loop confirmation above thresholds, and settlement-attestation logging with refund/cancellation receipt retention

**Pack-local conventions (not protocol requirements).** The DID + JWT identity pattern below is a reasonable engineering default, but it is *not* mandated by ACP, UCP, MPP, x402, or AP2. Adopt it only when the repo has no existing agent-identity scheme, and document it as a local decision:

- resolve agent customer identity through a cryptographically signed JWT with the `sub` claim set to the agent DID

## When to Use

- Adding paywall or metered access for AI agents (agent-to-agent billing via x402)
- Integrating agent payment settlement over fiat, cards, or stablecoins (Stripe MPP, x402)
- Exposing agent checkout (discovery → capability negotiation → checkout) via UCP
- Resolving delegated purchase authority (spending limits, mandates) via AP2 / delegated-authorization context
- Making a service discoverable in agentic commerce directories via ACP

## Suggested Process

1. **Define commerce scope**: Identify which endpoints require payment, which are free, and which require UCP context before serving.
2. **Set up x402 paywall**: Implement the `402 Payment Required` response for paywalled endpoints — include a valid payment manifest with accepted tokens, amounts, and network identifiers.
3. **Implement MPP endpoint**: Mount the Machine Payments Protocol handler to receive and verify token payment proofs from agent clients.
4. **Mount checkout + delegation endpoints**: Expose UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) checkout at its spec path for agent discovery and checkout; resolve consumer delegation limits and preferences for authenticated agent sessions via an AP2 mandate / delegated-authorization context (not "UCP").
5. **Expose discovery surfaces**: Publish `/.well-known/ucp` for UCP capability discovery, and mount the ACP REST endpoints (`/checkout_sessions`, `/agentic_commerce/delegate_payment`) plus the product feed. Confirm current paths against the published specs first.
6. **Validate agent-side flow**: Test the full payment cycle — agent sends 402 request → receives manifest → pays → retries with proof → receives resource.
7. **Review security posture**: Confirm payment proof validation is server-side, not bypassable client-side. Confirm UCP tokens are scoped and non-transferable.

### The x402 HTTP Payment Protocol

x402 (Coinbase + Cloudflare origin; now stewarded by the x402 Foundation under the Linux Foundation) defines a programmatic agent-to-agent payment negotiation standard over HTTP 402:
- **HTTP 402 Flow**: Paywalled endpoints respond with `402 Payment Required` to request a payment before serving the requested resource.
- **Server challenge**: The server states its payment requirements in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` response header and JSON body — accepted schemes, amount, asset, network, and pay-to address. The server never sends a payment credential header.
- **Client credential**: The agent pays autonomously (local wallet or pre-approved limits) and retries the original request carrying its signed payment payload in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` request header.
- **Server receipt**: On success the server returns the settlement receipt in the `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header alongside the `200 OK` resource.
- **A2A Programmatic Design**: The negotiation, authorization, and confirmation must be completely machine-to-machine, avoiding any dependency on interactive web views or human confirmation.
- **Version migration**: v1 used a single client-sent `X-PAYMENT` header and a server-sent `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE`. v2 renamed all three headers as above. When supporting both, branch on which header the client presents; do not emit `X-PAYMENT` from the server under either version.
- **Payload contents**: read the exact field names from the current x402 schema rather than hand-rolling them. The requirement set covers scheme, network, asset, amount in the asset's smallest unit, pay-to address, and a resource/nonce binding; the client payload carries the signed authorization for that specific requirement set.

### Stripe Machine Payments Protocol (MPP)

Stripe Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) enables automated billing and payment processing for machine clients:
- **MPP Client Setup**: Register agents with Stripe MPP to assign programmatic payment credentials and wallets.
- **Transaction Settlement**: The MPP gateway executes transfer requests and generates cryptographic proofs of payment immediately upon settlement.
- **Offline Verification**: The service provider validates the proof against Stripe's public ledger or API keys, eliminating synchronous external dependencies during path execution.
- **MPP Integration and Security**:
  * Establish Stripe MPP Webhook endpoints to handle asynchronous settlement events (such as `payment_intent.succeeded` with machine metadata).
  * Configure public key caching on the service provider to verify the cryptographic signatures on payment proofs without calling Stripe APIs on every request.
  * Utilize Stripe's delegated authorization flows to set limits and velocity controls (e.g., maximum $5.00 per transaction, $50.00 daily budget) for each machine credential.
- **Offline Ledger Settlement**:
  * For micro-transactions, agents can settle payments using an offline-first ledger, batching transaction confirmations to the main payment network once a specific threshold is reached.

### Discovery Surfaces: UCP and ACP

The two protocols expose themselves differently. Do not assume a shared `.well-known` manifest — that pattern does not exist for ACP:

- **UCP discovery**: UCP publishes a well-known document at `/.well-known/ucp` for capability discovery. This is the file to author when you want agents to negotiate capabilities before checkout.
- **ACP surface**: ACP is defined by REST endpoints plus a product feed, not by a well-known manifest. Implement the spec's endpoints — `/checkout_sessions` for the checkout lifecycle and `/agentic_commerce/delegate_payment` for payment delegation — and publish the product feed in the format the spec requires.
- **Verify before authoring**: both specs are moving fast. Read the current published spec for the exact paths and payload shapes rather than trusting any path memorized in this skill. If a path in this file disagrees with the spec, the spec wins and this file is the bug.
- **Delegated authorization context (AP2 mandate / delegated tokens)**: Expose consumer context attributes so agents can retrieve user preferences, organizational policies, and billing limits safely. This is the AP2/delegation layer — do not label it "UCP" (UCP is the Universal Commerce Protocol checkout layer).
- **Delegated purchase authority (AP2 mandate)**: When a user delegates commerce actions to an agent, the agent presents a signed mandate proving the user authorized the purchase, bounded by spending allowances, shipping preference overrides, and authorized merchants. AP2 mandates are the authorization artifact; the transport binding is defined by AP2, so read it from the spec rather than assuming a bespoke `delegation_token` header.

### Agent Customer Identity and DID Mapping (pack-local pattern)

None of ACP, UCP, MPP, x402, or AP2 mandates the following identity scheme. It is a pack-local default for repos that do not already have an agent-identity mechanism; prefer an existing repo scheme when one exists, and record the choice as a decision.

To track billing usage and enforce access control, the system maps agents to persistent customer records:
- **Decentralized Identifiers**: Every agent must possess a unique Decentralized Identifier (DID) representing its cryptographic identity.
- **Token Claims**: Authenticated requests must include a cryptographically signed JSON Web Token (JWT) where the `sub` claim maps directly to the agent's DID.
- **Identity Resolution**: Resolve the token signature against the agent's public keys discovered via its DID document.
- **DID and Customer Binding**:
  * Establish a database mapping layer between the agent's DID (`did:key:...` or `did:ion:...`) and a Stripe Customer ID or internal billing account.
  * Implement caching for DID documents to avoid network lookups during authentication, checking signatures against the cached public key.
  * Validate delegation chains using the JSON Web Token (`delegation` claim) to ensure the agent is authorized to act on behalf of the customer DID.

### Machine-to-Machine Payment Negotiation Flow

The dynamic negotiation between agent and service follows a strict programmatic sequence:
1. **Initial Access Attempt**: The agent requests a paywalled resource without credentials.
2. **Payment Required Challenge**: The service responds with HTTP 402, stating its requirements in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header and JSON body. No `WWW-Authenticate` header is involved.
3. **Agent Decision & Transfer**: The agent verifies the amount against its local delegation limits, initiates payment via Stripe MPP or local crypto wallet, and retrieves a cryptographic payment proof.
4. **Resubmission with Proof**: The agent retries the original request, attaching its signed payload in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header.
5. **Validation and Delivery**: The service validates the payment proof, returns the settlement receipt in `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`, and delivers the resource with HTTP 200.
- **Idempotency and Deduplication**:
  * Bind each payment to the specific requirement set it answers (resource plus nonce) so a signature cannot be replayed against a different request.
  * The merchant's service tracks settled payment identifiers in a transactional cache (e.g., Redis) to ensure duplicate request replays do not result in multiple ledger charges or credit deductions.

## Output Format

- `/.well-known/ucp` — UCP capability discovery document
- ACP REST endpoints (`/checkout_sessions`, `/agentic_commerce/delegate_payment`) plus product feed
- x402 payment requirements (in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header and 402 response body)
- MPP handler endpoint returning `200 OK` on valid proof
- UCP checkout endpoint + AP2 delegated-authorization endpoint returning consumer context object

## Checklist

- [ ] x402 endpoints return `402 Payment Required` with requirements in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header and body; no `WWW-Authenticate` header is emitted.
- [ ] x402 v2 header names are used end to end (`PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`); the server never emits `X-PAYMENT`.
- [ ] Payment requirements include accepted schemes, amounts in smallest asset units, and network IDs.
- [ ] MPP endpoint verifies payment proof server-side before granting access.
- [ ] UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) checkout endpoint is exposed; delegated-authorization (AP2 mandate) context correctly resolves consumer spending limits and preferences.
- [ ] Discovery surfaces match the current specs: `/.well-known/ucp` for UCP, REST endpoints plus product feed for ACP.
- [ ] API responses use correct media types for agent consumption (`application/json`).
- [ ] Client validation rejects malformed or replayed payment proofs; each signature is bound to one resource plus nonce.
- [ ] Paywalled vs free endpoints are clearly separated and not crossable.
- [ ] Agent identity scheme is either the repo's existing mechanism or the pack-local DID+JWT pattern, and the choice is documented as a local decision.

## Related Skills

- **configure-oauth-metadata**: Configure agentic authorization metadata — often prerequisite for UCP token validation.
- **manage-api-catalog**: Wire up linkset endpoints for commerce discovery alongside ACP.
- **configure-agent-headers**: Expose commerce discovery surfaces via HTTP Link headers.

## Output Contracts

Commerce configuration emits discovery and runtime artifacts; when the
configuration produces structured data that another agent must consume or
validate, emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/edge-deployment-spec.json`** for the deployable surface: which well-known paths are mounted (`/.well-known/ucp`, ACP REST endpoints, x402 handlers, MPP gateway), with their routes and content types.
- **`contracts/schemas/api-contract-spec.json`** for the per-protocol handler contracts (x402 challenge, MPP verify, UCP checkout, AP2 mandate verify), listing request/response schemas and auth requirements.
- For human-readable reports, emit a markdown summary of the protocols enabled, the discovery paths, and the security review checklist.

Skip structured emission for small repos where the same author both writes and consumes the config.

## Failure Modes

- **Wrong header name**: a deployment emits the legacy `X-PAYMENT` server-side. Mitigation: every server response uses v2 header names (`PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`); the client only sends `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
- **Discovery path drift**: an agent scanner hits a path that does not match the current spec. Mitigation: verify discovery paths against the current published spec before each deploy; treat the spec as the source of truth.
- **Mandate reuse**: an AP2 mandate is replayed against a different purchase. Mitigation: bind each mandate to a specific resource and nonce; reject reuse.
- **Credential emission**: a payment proof or token is logged or returned in a response body. Mitigation: classify outputs with `data-classification.yaml`; redact restricted fields before logging.
- **Spec conflation**: UCP (checkout) is mixed with AP2 (delegated authorization). Mitigation: keep the two layers separate; UCP negotiates capabilities, AP2 resolves spending limits.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: every payment or checkout call must be tied to a verified agent identity (DID or scope-bound token); reject anonymous or unverified agents.
- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: payment libraries and protocol SDKs must be schema-validated against the expected manifest before use; treat unknown versions as untrusted.
- **ASI05 RCE Guard**: never construct payment URLs, callback handlers, or signing inputs from external or user-supplied content without strict schema validation.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: payment proofs, mandates, and checkout sessions are untrusted inputs from the receiving endpoint's perspective; require signature verification at every boundary.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: surface spending limits and mandate boundaries honestly in user-facing copy; do not hide them to obtain faster sign-off.
