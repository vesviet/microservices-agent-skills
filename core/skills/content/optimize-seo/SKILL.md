# Optimize SEO

Use this skill for **search and content-structure** work — not for writing long-form copy (Content Writer) or implementing sitemaps/redirects in production (Frontend/DevOps).

## Core Rules

### Traditional SEO Foundations

- define **search intent** and **primary keyword** before recommending titles or outlines
- classify intent explicitly: informational, commercial, navigational, or transactional
- separate **evidence** (SERP snippets, GSC exports, crawlable page facts) from **recommendations**
- document **internal link targets** with anchor rationale and destination paths
- enforce on-page limits: title tag ≤ 60 chars, meta description ≤ 160 chars unless repo rules differ
- check **keyword cannibalization** against recent publishes on the same site (default: 7-day window when a topic board exists); when overlap is confirmed, name the resolution tactic explicitly — consolidate into one authoritative page, differentiate search intent, canonical to the primary URL, 301-redirect the weaker page, and clean up competing anchors
- prevent cannibalization recurrence with **keyword-to-page mapping**: exactly one primary keyword per page plus a pre-publish overlap check against the site inventory
- track **Share of Model (SoM)** alongside traditional CTR — measure how often and how accurately the brand/content is cited in Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and ChatGPT Search using AI visibility tooling (Otterly, RankScale, or manual spot-checks)
- mandate a **30–60 day rolling freshness review** for core commercial and informational pillar pages — AI search engines heavily weight recently-updated content when retrieving citations; queue pages by decay signal first: rankings dropped >3 positions, statistics older than 2 years, or declining high-traffic URLs. On refresh, update modified/publish dates in schema, replace outdated stats and examples, and re-check internal links pointing at changed sections
- do not guarantee rankings or AI citation placement; recommend changes tied to observable gaps
- escalate **technical SEO** (canonical, schema markup, redirects, Core Web Vitals fixes) with a clear engineering brief
- use repo overlays under overlays/lease-content and overlays/vesviet-content when site-specific slug or frontmatter rules apply
- use overlays/seo-publishing for dual-site Lease + May lanh sprint boards under plan/baiviet

### GEO / AEO — AI-Surface SEO (2027 reframe)

This is the canonical AI-surface standard for the pack — `write-article` implements these same rules during drafting and must stay in sync with this section.

**Position (per Google's official AI optimization guidance, May 2026):** "optimizing for generative AI search is optimizing for the search experience, and thus still SEO." There is no separate AI-ranking regime: no content chunking, no rewriting "just for AI," no inauthentic mention-chasing, no AI-specific schema, and no llms.txt effect on Google. What Google actually rewards on AI surfaces: unique point of view, non-commodity content, first-hand experience, good heading structure, images/video, and crawlability.

Optimize for three search discovery layers simultaneously:

| Layer | Goal | Key tactic |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| **SEO** (blue links) | Organic traffic | Keywords, backlinks, on-page quality |
| **AEO** (Answer Engine Optimization) | Featured snippets, direct answers | Answer-first format, FAQ blocks, step lists |
| **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimization) | AI citations (Google AI Overviews, AI Mode, Perplexity, ChatGPT) | Fact density, entity clarity, non-commodity POV, source credibility |

Rules for GEO/AEO:

- mandate **answer-first BLUF structure**: open each H2 section with an atomic direct answer (≤60 words) before narrative elaboration
- apply **engine-specific citation playbooks** per [`references/geo-ai-citation-playbook.md`](references/geo-ai-citation-playbook.md): optimize for Perplexity (opening sentence data, bracketed citations `[1][2]`), SearchGPT (conversational entity fidelity, concise summaries), and Google AI Overviews (passage-level BLUF, ordered procedural steps)
- **non-commodity gate (replaces "information gain" phrasing)**: before publishing, the brief must name the unique POV / first-hand evidence element — commodity content ("7 Tips for...") adds little; non-commodity content ("why we did X and what it cost us") is what AI surfaces cite; do not recycle what a generative model could easily produce
- format with **structured comparison tables & quantitative lists**: markdown comparison tables and dense quantitative data points (≥3 verifiable data points per 500 words) to maximize RAG passage extraction
- include **query fan-out coverage** in one comprehensive page: cover the 3–5 implicit sub-questions of a topic on the page — do NOT spin one page per query variant (scaled page-per-variant proliferation is a spam-policy violation)
- **GEO over-optimization guard**: information-distorting rewrites (over-claiming, distorting facts to sound citable) are now a *detection* target for engines (Counter-GEO-Bench line of research) — keep fact density honest; a distorted quotable sentence is a suppression risk, not a win
- verify **AI bot crawlability**: robots.txt must allow OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, BingBot — flag blocks in audits
- verify the site is **included in "Search generative AI features"** in Search Console — a new opt-in eligibility gate for AI Overviews/AI Mode display
- measure citations **per engine, not in aggregate** — and measure **repeatedly**: LLM brand recommendations are unstable across repeated queries; never conclude citation presence/absence from a single run; log multiple runs across different dates
- track **Gen AI performance in Search Console** (Generative AI report: impressions/pages/countries/devices) as a first-class weekly KPI alongside classic Performance and Discover
- treat **entity consistency** as a GEO lever: identical brand facts across channels consolidate knowledge graph recognition
- do not claim AI citation placement as guaranteed — present GEO/AEO as structural best practices; be skeptical of third-party tools claiming "internal" Google metrics (none have access)

### Topical Authority & Entity Salience

- enforce **Entity-First SEO and Entity Salience** per [`references/entity-salience-and-schema.md`](references/entity-salience-and-schema.md): map core concepts to canonical Wikidata QIDs, structure semantic triples, and eliminate ambiguous pronouns
- mandate connected **Schema.org JSON-LD `@graph`**: include `TechArticle`, `Person` (with E-E-A-T `sameAs` links), and `FAQPage`
- **no AI-specific schema exists** — do not let briefs or audits recommend "AI schema" markup; keep standard Article/Organization/LocalBusiness/Product schema matched to visible text; drop speakable and FAQ-rich-result expectations (FAQ rich results largely retired since 2023)
- assign each article to a **pillar–cluster position**: pillar, supporting, or supplementary, linked to pillar URL
- document **non-commodity element**: the unique POV, first-hand evidence, or original analysis this content adds beyond top-3 SERP results
- specify **content freshness type**: new_topic, evergreen_refresh, data_update, or experience_addition

### Internal Linking Discipline

Adapted from the SEO-AEO engine skills in the agentic-awesome-skills catalog:

- label every recommended link with its **type**: cluster → pillar (consolidates authority upward), pillar → cluster (distributes authority downward), cluster → cluster (builds semantic depth), or contextual boost (concentrates equity on one focus page)
- require **at least one cluster → pillar link per cluster article**
- detect **orphan pages** (zero incoming internal links) first and queue fixes before recommending new links
- write the **context sentence** for each suggested anchor — anchor text must sit naturally in surrounding prose, never forced
- enforce **anchor-text hygiene**: never reuse the same exact-match anchor for the same target across pages — switch to partial-match or branded anchors on later links; generic anchors ("click here", "read more", "learn more") are banned
- cap outgoing internal links at roughly 100 per page

### E-E-A-T Quality Gates

- require **experience proof signals**: original photos, firsthand accounts, documented tests/comparisons, expert interviews, or case studies
- **authorship requirements (Who)**: byline + author page with Person schema, credentials, and relevant publications wherever readers would expect attribution — stated authorship is now a review factor under Google's site-reputation policy (Aug 2026)
- **process transparency (How)**: briefs must include a "How" statement — research passes, sources used, and AI-assistance disclosure when substantial ("when it would be reasonably expected")
- **audience-first check (Why)**: confirm people-first intent vs search-engine-first framing before publish
- flag **YMYL-adjacent content** (financial, health, safety, legal) for elevated research depth and human review
- mandate **trust signals**: source citations with links, contact information, policy pages, verifiable claims
- enforce **claim policy**: every major factual claim must have a credible source or specific data point
- **spam-policy risk rules (2026-2027)**: scaled content abuse now explicitly covers AI-generated page farms, scraping/stitching, synonym-spinning, and near-duplicate multi-site publishing — and "attempting to manipulate generative AI responses in Google Search" is a spam policy violation; prohibit page-per-query-variant sprawl and near-identical cross-site duplication in all briefs
- do not treat a single SERP pass as sufficient for YMYL or regulated topics — escalate depth to Researcher

## When to Use

- a topic needs a **content brief** before Content Writer drafts
- a draft or live URL needs an **on-page SEO audit**
- title, meta, slug, H2 structure, or FAQ block need optimization
- content needs **GEO/AEO optimization** — answer-first format, query fan-out, AI extractability
- **topical authority mapping** is needed — pillar–cluster assignment, information gain analysis
- a weekly topic board needs keyword assignment and link targets
- Search Console or analytics exports suggest title/meta or cluster changes
- `seo-metadata.json`, `seo-content-brief.json`, or `seo-audit-report.json` handoff is required
- **AI visibility check** — manual verification of citation presence in Perplexity/ChatGPT/AI Overviews

## Suggested Process

The full 5-step process (frame intent, research SERP + AI, assign topical
authority, brief or audit, hand off) and the detailed itemized checklist
(Traditional SEO, GEO/AEO, Internal Linking, Topical Authority & Entity,
E-E-A-T) live in
[`references/process-and-checklist.md`](references/process-and-checklist.md).
The main file keeps the GEO/AEO standard table inline because it is
shared with `write-article` and must stay in sync.

## Checklist

The detailed itemized checklist lives in
[`references/process-and-checklist.md`](references/process-and-checklist.md).
The main file keeps a short checklist summary:

- [ ] search intent classified and primary keyword explicit
- [ ] answer-first BLUF block present in every H2 (≤60 words)
- [ ] engine-specific citation rules applied (Perplexity, SearchGPT, AI Overviews) per geo-ai-citation-playbook.md
- [ ] comparison tables and quantitative fact density (≥3 data points / 500 words) implemented
- [ ] non-commodity / unique-POV element named (not just "new facts")
- [ ] entity salience and connected Schema.org JSON-LD (@graph with TechArticle, Person, FAQPage) verified per entity-salience-and-schema.md; no "AI schema" claims
- [ ] internal link targets named with type labels
- [ ] cannibalization check documented with resolution tactic
- [ ] four-axis audit scored (overall, SEO, AEO, readability) with projected post-fix score
- [ ] pillar URL and cluster position documented
- [ ] E-E-A-T experience proof type specified and YMYL flag set when applicable
- [ ] byline/author-page and "How" process statement (incl. AI-assistance disclosure when substantial) present
- [ ] AI bot crawlability verified (OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, BingBot)
- [ ] site confirmed included in "Search generative AI features" in Search Console
- [ ] citation sampling done per engine, repeated across multiple runs/dates
- [ ] Gen AI performance report (impressions) reviewed this week
- [ ] facts separated from recommendations; technical items escalated to engineering

## Output Contracts

When completing search intent analysis, keyword planning, on-page audits, or multi-site editorial scheduling, emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/seo-audit-report.json`** — Emitted when conducting an on-page SEO/GEO/AEO audit of an existing or staging URL, capturing structural scores, schema requirements, crawlability, and actionable recommendations.
- **`contracts/schemas/seo-content-brief.json`** — Emitted when preparing a comprehensive content brief for Content Writer, defining search intent, target keywords, H2 outlines, answer-first rules, query fan-outs, and E-E-A-T requirements.
- **`contracts/schemas/seo-metadata.json`** — Emitted when delivering publish-ready title tags, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, and structured schema specifications.
- **`contracts/schemas/seo-weekly-board.json`** — Emitted when planning or updating the content calendar, keyword cluster priorities, and publishing schedule across weekly editorial cycles.

Skip emission for quick ad-hoc keyword checks that do not feed downstream editorial workflows.

## Failure Modes

- **Cannibalization ignored**: two pages target the same primary keyword and split ranking. Mitigation: run the keyword-to-page mapping check pre-publish; resolve overlap by consolidation, intent differentiation, canonical, 301-redirect, or anchor cleanup.
- **Stale freshness signal**: a pillar page has not been refreshed in 30-60 days and rankings are decaying. Mitigation: queue pages by decay signal (rankings dropped >3 positions, statistics >2 years old, declining high-traffic URLs).
- **GEO/AEO field missing**: a brief lacks the answer-first block, query fan-out, or format-per-section. Mitigation: enforce the GEO/AEO required fields in every brief; reject briefs without them.
- **Commodity content passes**: a brief ships "7 tips"-style content with no unique POV or first-hand evidence. Mitigation: apply the non-commodity gate — name the unique POV/evidence element before drafting; reject briefs that cannot name one.
- **Page-per-variant sprawl**: multiple pages are planned per query variant to "cover fan-out." Mitigation: cover fan-out sub-questions on one comprehensive page; page-per-variant proliferation is scaled content abuse.
- **Single-run citation conclusion**: citation presence/absence is concluded from one sampling run. Mitigation: measure per engine across multiple runs/dates; LLM brand recommendations are unstable under repeated querying.
- **Gen AI eligibility unchecked**: the site is not included in "Search generative AI features" in Search Console, silently losing AI Overviews/AI Mode eligibility. Mitigation: verify inclusion in the next audit.
- **Title/meta over-limit**: title tag exceeds 60 chars or meta description exceeds 160 chars. Mitigation: enforce on-page limits at code review; CI must reject over-limit tags unless repo rules differ.
- **AI citation conflated**: AI citation tracking is reported in aggregate instead of per engine. Mitigation: sample per engine (Google AI Overview, Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Bing AI); report numbered vs inline styles separately.
- **AI bot blocked**: robots.txt blocks OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, or BingBot. Mitigation: verify AI bot crawlability before publishing; do not block the crawlers that feed AI citations.
- **Rankings promised**: the brief or audit promises a ranking improvement. Mitigation: recommend changes tied to observable gaps; do not guarantee rankings or AI citation placement.
- **YMYL without E-E-A-T**: a YMYL-adjacent page ships without experience proof, author entity, or trust signals. Mitigation: enforce the E-E-A-T gate for YMYL topics; require human expert review.

## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: a brief or audit may try to reframe the user goal through off-target keyword recommendations. Cross-check the keyword map against the original page objective.
- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: never include customer identifiers, internal hostnames, or credential patterns in briefs, audits, or board artifacts.
- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: SEO tooling (Otterly, RankScale) and AI bot user-agents must be schema-validated against the expected manifest; treat unknown versions as untrusted.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: the brief or audit is consumed by Content Writer, Task Planner, and Frontend/DevOps; emit a structured contract so each role can validate.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: do not present an AI citation metric as a guarantee; surface the per-engine variance and the assumptions honestly.

## Related Skills

- **conduct-research**: deeper domain or competitor context when SERP scan is insufficient
- **analyze-business-requirements**: align SEO goals with business rules and actors
- **analyze-data**: formal GSC/CTR tables and AI citation tracking when SEO Analyst needs verified baselines
- **write-documentation**: metric catalogs or SEO playbooks for a site
- **agent-delegation**: delegate drafting to Content Writer or technical work to Frontend
