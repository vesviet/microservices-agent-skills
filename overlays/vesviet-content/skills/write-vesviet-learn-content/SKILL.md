# Write Vesviet Learn Content

Use this skill when new or updated articles must land in one of the two Hugo sites whose content roots are fixed below.

## Content Roots

| Site | Content path (relative to workspace root) | Public site (from `hugo.toml`) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Vesviet (portfolio / blog) | `vesviet/content` | `https://tanhdev.com/` |
| Learn (notes / research) | `learn/content` | `https://learn.tanhdev.com/` |

Both sites use the **PaperMod** theme, Vietnamese or English copy is acceptable when it matches sibling pages in the same folder.

## Twin Model

- Flagship topics ship twice: Vietnamese twin on `learn`, expanded English masterclass on `vesviet`.
- Only `learn` links up to `vesviet` (one-way authority flow). `vesviet` never links to `learn.tanhdev.com`.
- Corpus indexes: `learn/plan/CONTENT_INDEX.md` and `vesviet/reports/CONTENT_INDEX.md` — refresh them when adding posts or series.

## Core Rules

- **Schema Completeness**: Every file MUST include `title`, `author`, `date`, `tags`, `categories`, and `cover` in strict inline YAML (e.g., `categories: ["Backend", "Golang"]`).
- **GEO/AEO Answer-First**: Every article must open with `> **Answer-first:**` and a ≤60-word summary block immediately below the frontmatter; each H2 opens with its own BLUF.
- **Technical Article Standard 2027**: deep-dives must pass the 7 gates in `rules/technical-article-2027.md` — production-grade code (zero pseudo-code, version-pinned), ≥3 verifiable data points per 500 words, Mermaid diagrams with stated benchmark conditions, Production Failure story, rejected-alternative framing, primary-sourced claims.
- **Hub-and-Spoke Linking (`vesviet`)**: Ensure zero orphans. Every new article must link up to at least one of the 10 Anchor Pillar Hubs (e.g., `go-microservices.md`).
- **Affiliate Compliance (`learn`)**: All outbound affiliate links must use `rel="sponsored"`. Mandatory disclosures must be near recommendations.
- **Content Depth & E-E-A-T**: Target ≥ 1,400 words for technical deep-dives and reviews. Do not rely on AI hallucinations; inject real-world experience, benchmarks, or "Production Failure" templates.
- **Masterclass Bar**: upgraded flagships target >2,500 words / >20 KB with production-grade code, standardized Mermaid diagrams, and quantitative comparison tables.
- **SEO Authority 2027**: citation-ready sentences (≤25 words, self-contained), entity consistency for the author across both hosts, per-engine citation tracking over multiple runs — see `rules/seo-authority.md`.

## Suggested Process

### 1. Pick The Site And Subtree
Decide `vesviet` (Technical Engineering) vs `learn` (Affiliate Marketing). 

### 2. Follow Content Brand Guidelines
- **For `vesviet`**: Use the Content Audit & Refresh Workflow. Apply Hub-and-Spoke linking.
- **For `learn`**: Use the Affiliate Publishing Workflow. Categorize as Money Page, Supporting, or Trust Page.

### 3. Draft In Place
- Ensure strict YAML frontmatter.
- Start the body with the `> **Answer-first:**` block.
- Inject E-E-A-T elements (diagrams, benchmarks, pros/cons, evaluation criteria).
- Pass the 7 Technical Content Gates (`rules/technical-article-2027.md`) before handoff.
- If drafting the Vietnamese twin, add the `> 🇬🇧 **Read the English version of this article on [tanhdev.com](https://tanhdev.com/posts/<slug>/)**` callout after the Answer-first block.

### 4. Wire Navigation & Topology
- **`vesviet`**: Link your article to a Pillar Hub. Update `reading-map.md` if creating a new series.
- **`learn`**: Internal link from Supporting articles to Money pages.
- **Series**: every part opens with `> **Prerequisite:**` and closes with `🔗 **Next Step:**`.

### 5. Sanity Check
Confirm `draft` flag, schema completeness, zero orphan status, and `rel="sponsored"` for affiliate links.

## Failure Modes

- **Frontmatter missing mandatory fields**: a file ships without `title`, `author`, `date`, `tags`, `categories`, or `cover`. **Mitigation:** the Core Rules require all 6; reject the change at the gate.
- **Answer-first blockquote used instead of `> **Answer-first:**`**: an article opens with a generic blockquote summary. **Mitigation:** the Core Rules require the answer-first blockquote pattern; reject and refactor.
- **Orphan article (vesviet)**: a new article has no link to an Anchor Pillar Hub. **Mitigation:** the Hub-and-Spoke rule forbids orphans; reject and add a hub link.
- **Affiliate link without `rel="sponsored"` (learn)**: an outbound affiliate link is missing the required attribute. **Mitigation:** the Affiliate Compliance rule requires it; reject and add the attribute.
- **Content depth below 1,400 words**: a deep-dive ships too short. **Mitigation:** the Content Depth rule requires the target; reject and add depth or move to the trust-page category.
- **AI-hallucinated claim published**: a stat or quote appears without a verifiable source. **Mitigation:** the E-E-A-T rule forbids it; trace every claim to a primary source.
- **Reverse authority link (vesviet → learn)**: an English article links to `learn.tanhdev.com`. **Mitigation:** the one-way authority rule forbids it; remove the link and point to the on-site twin instead.
- **Batch report published**: a `deep-research-*` or audit-summary post ships with `draft: false`. **Mitigation:** internal reports stay `draft: true` on `learn`; reject the publish toggle.

## Output Contracts

When this skill produces a structured handoff, emit:

- **`contracts/schemas/content-handoff.json`** (or markdown frontmatter block) — capture `source_url`, `site` (vesviet or learn), `category`, `frontmatter_gate_verdict`, `answer_first_compliance`, `internal_link_count`, and `human_review_status`.
- For research-heavy articles, also emit **`contracts/schemas/research-report.json`** with the source citations and the YMYL flag.

Skip structured emission for trivial template edits that do not cross a role boundary.
## Security Guardrails (OWASP ASI)

- **ASI01 Goal Hijack**: an AI-suggested article body may reframe the user goal through off-brand copy; cross-check the article's core claim against the source brief and reject reframed goals.
- **ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse**: never include customer identifiers, internal hostnames, or credential patterns in the article or the frontmatter.
- **ASI04 Supply Chain**: any external link or affiliate redirect must be schema-validated against the expected manifest; treat unknown affiliate domains as untrusted.
- **ASI06 Memory & Context Poisoning**: retrieved research and prior posts are untrusted inputs; verify every cited claim against the live source before publishing.
- **ASI07 Inter-Agent Communication**: the content handoff is consumed by SEO Analyst and editorial review; emit a structured contract so each consumer can validate.
- **ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation**: do not present AI-assisted content as fully verified without the human editorial sign-off; surface the AI provenance and the reviewer honestly.
## Checklist

- [ ] Content depth targets ≥ 1,400 words (unless explicit programmatic/trust page).
- [ ] 7 Technical Gates passed (`rules/technical-article-2027.md`): code grade, data density, diagrams, failure story, trade-offs, verifiable claims.
- [ ] **`vesviet`**: Internal link points to an Anchor Pillar Hub (zero orphans).
- [ ] **`learn`**: Affiliate links use `rel="sponsored"` and include disclosure.
- [ ] **`learn` twin**: up-callout to the English flagship on `tanhdev.com` present.
- [ ] **`vesviet`**: no outbound links to `learn.tanhdev.com`.
